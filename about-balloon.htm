    <p>Balloon is a Scratch 1.4 mod adding new features to the normal Scratch (for example boolean conversions!). If you want a list of Scratch blocks Balloon adds, visit <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/702724/?page=1#post-7427906">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Why Balloon?</h3>
    <p>Well, I sometimes make totally random names for my accounts and etc. so if you want to know why did I pick balloon as a name for a Scratch mod, Balloon is just a completely random name :)</p>
    <h3>Who made Balloon?</h3>
    <p>Well, me probably XD. And if you ask who am I, I am pixells4D (You can visit my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/pixells4D/">Scratch Profile</a> if you want)!</p>
